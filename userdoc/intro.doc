<h2>
Introduction
</h2>

Mapyrus is software for creating plots of points, lines, polygons and text
to various output formats.
<p>

The software combines the following three components.
<ol>
<li>
A Logo or turtle graphics program.  An imaginary pen is moved around a page,
drawing shapes that appear on the screen, or are saved in an image file.
Reusable routines are built up using a BASIC-like language.
Branching and looping contructs allow complex shapes, symbols and patterns
to be be defined.  For example,

exec java -jar lib/mapyrus.jar doc/turtle.txt
<p>
<img src="turtle.png">
<p>
<!-- [sun, fractal, text bubble] -->

</li>
<li>
Reading and displaying of geographic information system (GIS) datasets.
Drawing routines are applied to mapping data to produce annotated and
symbolized maps.

Xexec java -jar lib/mapyrus.jar doc/mapview.txt
<img src="mapview.png">
<!-- [example map view] -->

</li>
<li>
Mapyrus runs as a stand-alone program, or as a multi-threaded server, or as a
servlet and is able to create web format images or PostScript plot files.

Please note that:
<ol>
<li>
Mapyrus has only a simple graphical user interface.  Commands
are typed into the interface, or into a text file which is then read.
</li>

<li>
Mapyrus cannot display three dimensional data and, in fact, has nothing to do
with 3D.

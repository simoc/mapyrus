Introduction
</h2>

Mapyrus is software for creating plots of points, lines, polygons and text
to PostScript and web image output formats.
<p>

The software combines the following three components.
<ol>
<li>
A Logo or turtle graphics program.  An imaginary pen is moved around a page,
creating shapes that are drawn into an image file.
Reusable routines are built up using a BASIC-like language.
Branching and looping contructs allow complex shapes, symbols and patterns
to be be defined.  For example,

<p>
<img src="turtle1.png">
&nbsp;
<img src="turtle2.png">
&nbsp;
<img src="turtle3.png">
&nbsp;
<img src="turtle4.png">
<p>

</li>
<li>
Reading and displaying of geographic information system (GIS) datasets.
Drawing routines are applied to mapping data to produce annotated and
symbolized maps and graphs.

Mapyrus runs as a stand-alone program, or as a multi-threaded HTTP server.

Please note that:
<ol>
<li>
Mapyrus has no graphical user interface.
Commands are typed into the terminal window in which the software is running,
or read from a text file prepared by the user.
</li>

<li>
Mapyrus cannot display three dimensional data and has nothing to do
with 3D.

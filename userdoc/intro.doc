<h2>
Introduction
</h2>

Mapyrus is software for creating plots of points, lines, polygons and labels 
to PostScript, Portable Document Format (PDF) and web image output formats.
<p>

The software combines the following three components.
<ol>
<li>
A Logo or turtle graphics program.  An imaginary pen is moved around a page,
creating shapes that are drawn into an image file.
Reusable routines are built up using a BASIC-like language.
Branching and looping contructs allow complex shapes, symbols and patterns
to be be defined.  For example,

<p>
<img src="turtle1.png">
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
<img src="turtle2.png">
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
<img src="turtle3.png">
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
<img src="turtle4.png">
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
<img src="turtle5.png">
<p>

</li>
<li>
Reading and displaying of geographic information
systems (GIS) datasets, text files, or tables held in a relational database.
Drawing routines are applied to geographic data to produce annotated and
symbolized maps and graphs.  Attributes of the geographic data control
the color, size, annotation and other characteristics of the
appearance of the geographic data.  For example,

<table>
<tr>
<td>
<img src="mapview1.png">
<td>
<img src="mapview2.png">
<td>
<img src="mapview3.png">
<td>
<img src="mapview4.png">
<tr align="center">

<td>
<b>
Average Monthly Temperatures
<br>
of Australian Cities
<br>
(degrees Celsius)
</b>
<td>
<b>Mineral Types</b>
<td>
<b>
Railways Lines in East Kent
</b>

</table>
<p>

</li>
<li>
Mapyrus runs as a stand-alone program suitable for use in a script and for
batch tasks, or as a simple HTTP server providing map and graph images and
text reports in a web-based application.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
&nbsp;
<p>
Please note that:
<ol>
<li>
Mapyrus is written in Java so as to be operating system independent
and take advantage of Java multi-threading,
Java2D and JDBC capabilities.
</li>

<li>
Mapyrus has no graphical user interface.
Commands are typed into the terminal window in which the software is running,
or read from a text file prepared by the user.
</li>

<li>
Mapyrus cannot display three dimensional data and has nothing to do
with 3D.
</li>

</ol>

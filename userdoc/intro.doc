<h2>
Introduction
</h2>

Mapyrus is software for creating plots of points, lines, polygons and text
to PostScript and web image output formats.
<p>

The software combines the following three components.
<ol>
<li>
A Logo or turtle graphics program.  An imaginary pen is moved around a page,
creating shapes that are drawn into an image file.
Reusable routines are built up using a BASIC-like language.
Branching and looping contructs allow complex shapes, symbols and patterns
to be be defined.  For example,

<p>
<img src="turtle1.png">
&nbsp;
<img src="turtle2.png">
&nbsp;
<img src="turtle3.png">
&nbsp;
<img src="turtle4.png">
<p>

</li>
<li>
Reading and displaying of from geographic information
systems (GIS) datasets, text files, or relational databases tables.
Drawing routines are applied to geographic data to produce annotated and
symbolized maps and graphs.  For example,

<p>
<img src="mapview1.png">
&nbsp;
<img src="mapview2.png">
<p>

</li>
<li>
Mapyrus runs as a stand-alone program, or as a multi-threaded HTTP server.
This makes development of simple web applications easy, showing
maps or graphs of datasets.

<p>
Please note that:
<ol>
<li>
Mapyrus has no graphical user interface.
Commands are typed into the terminal window in which the software is running,
or read from a text file prepared by the user.
</li>

<li>
Mapyrus cannot display three dimensional data and has nothing to do
with 3D.
</li>

<li>
For producing graphs of statistical data showing sample points,
a line of best fit,
X and Y axes with tick marks, other software such as 
<a href="www.gnuplot.org">gnuplot</a>.
is more suitable.
</li>

</ol>

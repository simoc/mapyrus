\subsection{Software Requirements}

Mapyrus requires:
\begin{itemize}
\item
Java 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition, (J2RE) 8 or higher,
or Java 2 Software Developers Kit, Standard Edition (J2SDK) 8 or higher.
\item
The \texttt{\$DISPLAY} environment variable set to an X-Windows display,
if running on Linux or a UNIX operating system.  If a real X-Windows display
is not available, use the \texttt{-Djava.awt.headless=true} startup variable.
\item
The \textit{JTS Topology Suite} from \texttt{http://www.tsusiatsoftware.net/jts/main.html},
if geometric functions are required
(see Table \ref{functions} on page \pageref{functions}).
\item
The \textit{Java PROJ.4 library} from \texttt{http://www.jhlabs.com/java/maps/proj},
if the \texttt{REPROJECT} function is required for reprojecting coordinates.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Usage}

The Mapyrus software is contained in a single Java JAR file.
Start Mapyrus in a Java interpreter with the following command.

\vspace{10pt}
\texttt{java -classpath \textit{install-dir}/mapyrus.jar org.mapyrus.Mapyrus \textit{filename} \dots}
\vspace{10pt}

\textit{install-path} is the directory in which
Mapyrus is installed.  \textit{filename} is the name of a file
or a URL for Mapyrus to read from.  If \textit{filename} is \texttt{-}
then standard input is read.  If several filenames and URLs are
given then they are read in turn.

Environment variables
and variables passed to Mapyrus using the Java \texttt{-D} option
are available in the Mapyrus interpreter.  The
\textit{JTS Topology Suite} JAR file and other JAR files
to be used in combination with Mapyrus are included in the
\texttt{-classpath} option.

\begin{alltt}
\texttt{java -D\textit{variable}=\textit{value} \dots\ \textbackslash
  -classpath \textit{install-dir}/mapyrus.jar:\textit{jts-dir}/jts-1.13.jar:\textit{other-jarfile} \textbackslash
  org.mapyrus.Mapyrus \textit{filename}}
\end{alltt}

Mapyrus runs as an HTTP Server when started with the
\texttt{-s} option.

\begin{alltt}
\texttt{java -classpath \textit{install-dir}/mapyrus.jar:\textit{jarfile} \textbackslash
  org.mapyrus.Mapyrus -s \textit{port} \textit{filename} \dots}
\end{alltt}

\label{morememory}
Use the
\texttt{-Xmx} Java option
to make more memory available when running Mapyrus.
To increase available memory to 256Mb, use the following command:

\begin{alltt}
\texttt{java -Xmx256m -classpath \textit{install-dir}/mapyrus.jar org.mapyrus.Mapyrus \textit{filename} \dots}
\end{alltt}

\subsubsection{Startup Configuration}

The variables available for configuring Mapyrus at startup are
shown in Table \ref{startupvariables}.

\endhead

\texttt{Mapyrus.rgb.file=\textit{filename}} &
Defines an X Windows color names file containing additional color names
for the
\texttt{color} command.  Default value is
\texttt{/usr/lib/X11/rgb.txt} \\

\hline

\texttt{java.awt.headless=true} &
Run in headless mode.  Required when running on a server
with no graphics display. \\

\hline

\texttt{java.io.tmpdir=\textit{dir}} &
Defines directory to use for temporary files.  Large images in PDF output
are temporarily saved in this directory until output is complete. \\

\hline

\texttt{jdbc.drivers=\textit{class}} &
Defines class containing JDBC 1.0 (or higher) driver to load at startup.
A JDBC driver is required for connecting to a relational database and
is provided as part of a relational database.
See the Java JDBC DriverManager API documentation
\footnote{Available from \texttt{https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/sql/DriverManager.html}}
for details.
The JAR file containing the class must be included in the \texttt{-classpath}
option when starting Mapyrus. \\

\hline
\end{longtable}

\subsection{Language}

Mapyrus interprets commands read from one or more plain text files.
Each command begins on a separate line or after a semi-colon (\texttt{;}).

Any part of a line following a hash (\texttt{\#}) or
a pair of slashes (\texttt{//}) that is not part of
a literal string is interpreted as a comment and is ignored.
C programming \texttt{/*} \ldots \texttt{*/} style
comments are also ignored.
Leading and
trailing spaces or tabs on a line are ignored too.  A backslash
(\texttt{\textbackslash}) character at the end of a line is interpreted as a
line continuation and the line and next line are joined into a single line.

A line beginning with the word \texttt{include}, followed by a filename
or URL includes commands from another file.

Each command is passed zero or more arguments separated by commas.
An argument is a number, a string literal in single quotes (\texttt{\'})
or double quotes (\texttt{\"}), a variable name, an array, an
array element or an expression.

In a string literal,
the character sequence \texttt{\textbackslash{}\textit{nnn}}
is interpreted as an octal character code (where
\texttt{\textit{nnn}} is one to three digits) and the character
sequence \texttt{\textbackslash{}u\textit{nnnn}} is interpreted
as a Unicode character (where \textit{nnnn} is four hexadecimal
digits).

An expression contains arguments and operators and functions
on those arguments, like in BASIC, C, or Python.
Available operators are shown in Table \ref{operators}.
Pre-defined functions are shown in Table \ref{functions}.
Java methods are also available as functions by giving the class name
and method name separated by a dot.  Only Java methods
declared as \texttt{public} and \texttt{static} are available
as functions.

\end{longtable}

An argument or expression is assigned to a named variable using the
\texttt{let} command and an equals sign (\texttt{=}).  A variable name begins
with a letter or dollar sign (\texttt{\$}) and contains only letters, numbers,
dots (\texttt{.}), underbars (\texttt{\_}) and colons (\texttt{:}).
Variable names are
case-sensitive.  Variables and array elements that are accessed without having
been defined have a value of zero, or an empty string.

Variables accepted as parameters to a function or procedure, or declared in the
function or procedure with the local command are local to that function or
procedure and not visible outside the function or procedure.  All other
variables are global.

Individual array elements are accessed by giving the index between
square brackets (\texttt{[} and \texttt{]}).
The index is any string or number value.
Multi-dimension arrays are available by using
indexes named \textit{index1}\texttt{."}\textit{c}\texttt{".}\textit{index2},
where \textit{c} is any character that never appears in an index.

An array with sequential indexes starting at 1 is defined as a single
argument by surrounding the values by square brackets
\texttt{[\textit{value1}, \textit{value2}, ... ]}.
To define both keys and values for an array use
\texttt{\{"\textit{key1}": \textit{value1}, "\textit{key2}": \textit{value2}, ... \}}.

The \texttt{if}, \texttt{repeat}, \texttt{while}, \texttt{for}
and \texttt{function} flow control structures
found in other languages are available:

\begin{alltt}
if \textit{condition} then
  \textit{then-commands} ...
else
  \textit{else-commands} ...
endif

if \textit{condition} then \textit{command}; \textit{command}; else \textit{command}; \textit{command}; endif
\end{alltt}

Executes \textit{then-commands} if \textit{condition} evaluates to
a non-zero value, otherwise \textit{else-commands} are executed.
The \texttt{else} part is optional.
Compound tests are built using the \texttt{elif} keyword:

\begin{alltt}
if \textit{condition} then
  \textit{commands} \dots
elif \textit{condition} then
  \textit{commands} \dots
endif
\end{alltt}

The \texttt{repeat} keyword defines a loop in which
\textit{commands} will be executed \textit{count}
times:

\begin{alltt}
repeat \textit{count} do
  \textit{commands} \dots
done

repeat \textit{count} do \textit{command}; \textit{command}; done
\end{alltt}

The \texttt{while} keyword defines a loop in which
\textit{commands} will be executed for as long
as \textit{condition} continues to evaluate to a non-zero value:

\begin{alltt}
while \textit{condition} do
  \textit{commands} \dots
done

while \textit{condition} do \textit{command}; \textit{command}; done
\end{alltt}

The \texttt{for} \dots \texttt{in} keywords define a loop in which
each element of \textit{array} is assigned to variable \textit{var}
and \textit{commands} are executed.
Elements in \textit{array} are accessed in numerical index order if
indexes are numeric, otherwise in alphabetical index order:

\begin{alltt}
for \textit{var} in \textit{array} do
  \textit{commands} \dots
done

for \textit{var} in \textit{array} do \textit{command}; \textit{command}; done
\end{alltt}

Functions are used to repeat commonly used calculations and to
return a value:

\begin{alltt}
function \textit{name} [\textit{arg1}, \dots]
  \textit{commands} \dots
  \texttt{return} \textit{arg}
end

function \textit{name} [\textit{arg1}, \dots]; \textit{command}; \textit{command}; \texttt{return} \textit{arg}; end
\end{alltt}

Procedures group frequently used commands together, save
graphics state when they begin and restore it when they end,
isolating the calling procedure from any changes:

\begin{alltt}
begin \textit{name} [\textit{arg1}, \dots]
  \textit{commands} \dots
end

begin \textit{name} [\textit{arg1}, \dots]; \textit{command}; \textit{command}; end
\end{alltt}

A procedure is defined to take a fixed number of arguments.
All procedure names are global and following the same naming
rules as variables.
Procedure definitions within a procedure are not allowed.
The \texttt{return} keyword returns a
from a procedure to the calling procedure.

A procedure is called from any place where a command is accepted
and the number of arguments passed must match the number 
in the procedure definition.

Before commands in the procedure are executed
the graphics state is saved.
\label{graphicsstate}
The graphics state is restored when the procedure finishes.
The graphics state contains:

\begin{enumerate}
\item
The path defined with
\texttt{move},
\texttt{draw},
\texttt{box},
\texttt{arc},
\texttt{bezier},
\texttt{circle},
\texttt{cylinder},
\texttt{ellipse},
\texttt{hexagon},
\texttt{pentagon},
\texttt{sinewave},
\texttt{spiral},
\texttt{star},
\texttt{triangle},
\texttt{wedge}
and
\texttt{addpath}
commands.

\item
The clip path defined with
\texttt{clip} commands.

\item
Current drawing settings set by
\texttt{color},
\texttt{linestyle},
\texttt{font} and \texttt{justify}
commands.

\item
Transformations set by \texttt{rotate} and \texttt{scale} commands.

\item
The output file set by a \texttt{setoutput} command.
\end{enumerate}

Any new page created in a procedure with a
\texttt{newpage}
command is completed when the procedure finishes and output
returns to the page being created before the procedure was called.

Any dataset being read is global and protected regions are global.
They are not saved and not restored.

Any world coordinate system set with the \texttt{worlds} command is cleared
before the commands in the procedure are executed.  This enables the calling
procedure to work in a world coordinate system and the called procedure to draw
at these world coordinate positions using measurements in millimeters.

If the current path contains only \texttt{move} points and no straight line or
arc segments when a procedure is called then the procedure is called
repeatedly, one time for each move point, with the origin (0, 0) translated to
the \texttt{move} point each time and the path reset to empty.  Therefore,
coordinates in the called procedure are relative to the move point.  This
enables drawing commands in the called procedure to be given in millimeters,
relative to each \texttt{move} point.

\subsection{Internal Variables}

All environment variables and
Java standard system properties (\texttt{os.arch}, \texttt{user.dir}, etc.)
are defined as variables in Mapyrus.

Mapyrus maintains the internal variables shown in Table \ref{internalvariables}.

\subsection{Commands}

Commands are listed alphabetically.  The arguments required for each command
are given.  Some commands accept arguments in several ways.  For these
commands, each combination of arguments is given.

\subsubsection{addpath}

\begin{alltt}
addpath \textit{geometry-field} [, \textit{geometry-field} ...]
\end{alltt}

Adds geometry in each \textit{geometry-field} to current path.
A \textit{geometry-field} is geometry fetched from a dataset
with a \texttt{fetch} command or a string containing an
OGC WKT geometry.

Coordinates are transformed through any
transformation set with a \texttt{worlds} command,
then scaled and rotated by \texttt{scale}
and \texttt{rotate} values.

\subsubsection{arc}

\begin{alltt}
arc \textit{direction}, \textit{xCenter}, \textit{yCenter}, \textit{xEnd}, \textit{yEnd}
\end{alltt}

Adds a circular arc to the current path.  The arc begins at
the last point added to the path and ends at (\textit{xEnd}, \textit{yEnd})
with center at (\textit{xCenter}, \textit{yCenter}).
If \textit{direction} is a positive number, the arc travels clockwise,
otherwise the arc travels in an anti-clockwise direction.
If the begin and end points are the same then the arc is a complete circle.
A straight line segment is first added to the path if
the distance from the beginning point to the center is different
to the distance from the center to the end point.

Points are transformed through any
transformation set with a \textit{worlds} command,
then scaled and rotated by \textit{scale}
and \textit{rotate} values.

\subsubsection{bezier}

\begin{alltt}
bezier \textit{xControl1}, \textit{yControl1}, \textit{xControl2}, \textit{yControl2}, \textit{xEnd}, \textit{yEnd}
\end{alltt}

Adds a Bezier curve (a spline curve) to the current path.  The curve begins at
the last point added to the path and ends at (\textit{xEnd}, \textit{yEnd})
with control points (\textit{xControl1}, \textit{yControl1}) and
(\textit{xControl2}, \textit{yControl2}).

The control points define the direction of the line at the start and
end points of the Bezier curve.
At the start of the Bezier curve, the direction of the curve is towards
the first control point.
At the end of the Bezier curve, the direction of the curve is from
the second control point.

Points are transformed through any
transformation set with a \textit{worlds} command,
then scaled and rotated by \textit{scale}
and \textit{rotate} values.

\subsubsection{blend}

\begin{alltt}
blend \textit{mode}
\end{alltt}

Sets the blend mode for transparent colors.
Transparent colors are mixed differently with background
colors depending on the blend mode.

Blend mode is one of \texttt{Normal},
\texttt{Multiply},
\texttt{Screen},
\texttt{Overlay},
\texttt{Darken},
\texttt{Lighten},
\texttt{ColorDodge},
\texttt{ColorBurn},
\texttt{HardLight},
\texttt{SoftLight},
\texttt{Difference} or
\texttt{Exclusion}.

The effect of each blend mode is described in the PDF Reference Manual,
available from \texttt{http://www.adobe.com}.
Only the first six blend modes are available for SVG format output.

\subsubsection{box}

\begin{alltt}

\end{alltt}

Adds a rectangle to the current path.
The points
(\textit{x1}, \textit{y1}) and (\textit{x2}, \textit{y2}) define
any two opposite corners of the rectangle.

The two corner points of the box
are first transformed through any world coordinate
transformation set with a \texttt{worlds} command,
then scaled and rotated by \texttt{scale}
and \texttt{rotate} values.

\subsubsection{box3d}

\begin{alltt}
box3d \textit{x1}, \textit{y1}, \textit{x2}, \textit{y2} [, \textit{depth}]
\end{alltt}

Adds a rectangle to the current path in the same way as
the \texttt{box} command.  The right side and top sides of the
box are also added to the current path to give a 3 dimensional effect.

The depth of the right and top sides is optional.  If not given
then the the smaller of box height and box width is used.

The two corner points and depth of the box
are first transformed through any world coordinate
transformation set with a \texttt{worlds} command,
then scaled and rotated by \texttt{scale}
and \texttt{rotate} values.

\subsubsection{chessboard}

\begin{alltt}
chessboard \textit{x1}, \textit{y1}, \textit{x2}, \textit{y2}, \textit{size}
\end{alltt}

Adds squares in a chessboard pattern to the current path.
The points
(\textit{x1}, \textit{y1}) and (\textit{x2}, \textit{y2}) define
any two opposite corners of a rectangular area for the pattern, with
\textit{size} defining the size of each square.

The two corner points and size of squares
are first transformed through any world coordinate
transformation set with a \texttt{worlds} command,
then scaled and rotated by \texttt{scale}
and \texttt{rotate} values.

\subsubsection{circle}

\begin{alltt}
circle \textit{xCenter}, \textit{yCenter}, \textit{radius}
\end{alltt}

Adds a circle to the current path, with center
point (\textit{xCenter}, \textit{yCenter}) and radius
\textit{radius}.

The center point and radius are transformed through any
transformation set with a \textit{worlds} command,
then scaled and rotated by \textit{scale}
and \textit{rotate} values.

\subsubsection{clearpath}

\begin{alltt}
clearpath
\end{alltt}

Removes all points from the current path.

\subsubsection{clip}

\begin{alltt}
clip \textit{side}
\end{alltt}

Sets a clip path to the area covered by the current path,
or excluding the area covered by the current path, depending
on the value \textit{side}.

If \textit{side} has value \texttt{inside} then
later drawing commands are limited to draw only inside the area
covered by current path.
If \textit{side} has value \texttt{outside} then
later drawing commands are limited to draw only outside the area
covered by current path.

If the path is clipped in a procedure, then the area remains
clipped until the procedure is complete.  Otherwise, the area
remains permanently clipped for the page.
When more than one path is clipped, drawing is limited to
areas that satisfy all clip paths.

The current path is not modified by this command.

\subsubsection{closepath}

\begin{alltt}
closepath
\end{alltt}

Closes the current path by adding a straight line segment
back to the last point added with a \texttt{move} command.

color "rgb", \textit{red}, \textit{green}, \textit{blue} [, \textit{alpha}]
color "hsb", \textit{hue}, \textit{saturation}, \textit{brightness} [, \textit{alpha}]
color "cmyk", \textit{cyan}, \textit{magenta}, \textit{yellow}, \textit{black} [, \textit{alpha}]
\end{alltt}

Sets color for drawing.  Around 500 commonly used color names are defined,
additional color names are defined in a file given as a startup variable (see
Table \ref{startupvariables} on page \pageref{startupvariables}).
Color names are case-insensitive.

If color name is \texttt{contrast} then color is set to either black or white,
whichever constrasts more with the current color.

If color name is \texttt{brighter}, \texttt{darker} or \texttt{softer}
then color is set to a brighter, darker or softer version of the current color.

If color name is \texttt{current} then the current color is set again.

\textit{hexdigits} is a 6 digit hexadecimal
value defining RGB values, as used in HTML pages.

\textit{red}, \textit{green} and \textit{blue} values for RGB colors and
\textit{hue}, \textit{saturation} and \textit{brightness} values for
Hue-saturation-brightness (HSB) colors are given as intensities in the range
0-1.

\textit{cyan}, \textit{magenta}, \textit{yellow} and \textit{black}
values for CMYK colors are in the range 0-1.

The alpha value is optional and defines transparency as a value in the range
0-1.  An alpha value of 1 is completely opaque and the color overwrites
underlying colors.  An alpha value of 0 is completely transparent and the color
is not visible.  Intermediate values are partially transparent and the color is
blended with colors of underlying shapes on the page.  The
\texttt{blend} command controls how transparent colors are mixed
with background colors.

Colors are opaque if an alpha value is not given.

Transparent colors are only available for BMP, JPEG, PNG, PPM, SVG, PDF
and Encapsulated PostScript format image (\texttt{epsimage}) output.

The PostScript language does not contain any functions for setting
transparency.
All colors in PostScript and Encapsulated PostScript
files will be opaque.

The spelling \texttt{colour} is also accepted for this command.

\subsubsection{cylinder}

\begin{alltt}
cylinder \textit{xCenter}, \textit{yCenter}, \textit{radius}, \textit{height}
\end{alltt}

Adds a cylindrical shape to the current path, with center
point (\textit{xCenter}, \textit{yCenter}) and given radius and height.

The center point, radius and height are transformed through any
transformation set with a \textit{worlds} command,
then scaled and rotated by \textit{scale}
and \textit{rotate} values.

\subsubsection{dataset}

\begin{alltt}
dataset \textit{format}, \textit{name} [, \textit{extras}]
\end{alltt}

Defines a dataset to read from.  A dataset contains geographic data,
geometry, attributes, a lookup table, data to write to standard
output, or a combination of these.

\textit{dataset} is the filename of the dataset to read.
\textit{format} is the format of the dataset and
\textit{extras} defines further options for accessing the dataset, given

Sets font for labelling with the \texttt{label} command.
Font \textit{name} and \textit{size} are the name and size in
millimeters of the font to use.

If a scale factor was set with the
\texttt{scale} command
then font size is scaled by this factor.

If a rotation was set with the
\texttt{rotate} command
then labels follow current rotation angle.
If no rotation is set then labels are displayed
horizontally.

Font \textit{name}
depends on the output format set with the
\texttt{newpage} command.
For PostScript output, \textit{name} is the name of a PostScript Type 1
font.
For output to an image format, \textit{name} is one of the Java Logical
font names (\texttt{Serif}, \texttt{SansSerif},
\texttt{Monospaced}, \texttt{Dialog}, or \texttt{DialogInput}) or a TrueType
font name.

Tutorial Sections \ref{psfonts}, \ref{ttffonts} and \ref{svgfonts}
describe different font formats.

\textit{extras} defines further options for the font, given as
\textit{variable=value} values, separated by whitespace.
See Table \ref{fontextras}
for available options.

\subsubsection{geoimage}

\begin{alltt}
geoimage \textit{filename} [, \textit{extras} ]
geoimage \textit{url} [, \textit{extras} ]
geoimage \textit{WebMapServiceUrl} [, \textit{extras} ]
\end{alltt}

Displays a geo-referenced image.

\textit{filename} or
\textit{url}
is the name of a BMP, GIF, JPEG, PNG, PPM or XBM format image file.
An associated "worlds" file with suffix \texttt{.tfw} must exist,
defining the world coordinate range covered by the image.
The \texttt{extras} option \texttt{readerclass} enables additional
image formats to be read using external Java classes.

\textit{webMapServiceUrl} is a URL request to an
OGC Web Mapping Service (WMS)
for an image.  The request type must be \texttt{GetMap}.
The world coordinate range for the image is parsed from the
\texttt{BBOX} parameter in the URL.
See the Web Map Service Implementation specification at
\texttt{http://www.opengis.org}
for details of all parameters that must be included in the URL.

\textit{extras} defines further options for the image, given as
\textit{variable=value} values, separated by whitespace.
See Table \ref{geoimageextras}
for available options.

Images cannot be displayed when creating SVG format output.

For PDF format output, large output images are saved as temporary
files in the Java temporary directory
(see Table \ref{startupvariables} on page \pageref{startupvariables})
until output is complete.

\texttt{clipfile=\textit{filename}} &

Gives name of a text file containing a clip polygon for the image.
Each line of the text file defines one (X, Y) world coordinate
of the clip polygon.
Only image data inside the clip polygon is displayed.
Using a clip polygon prevents display of a non-rectangular image
from overwriting a neighbouring image. \\

\texttt{hue=\textit{factor}}
\texttt{saturation=\textit{factor}}
\texttt{brightness=\textit{factor}}
&

Defines a hue, saturation or brightness multiplication factor for the image. \\

\texttt{readerclass=\textit{classname}} &

Gives the name of a Java class to read the image and the world
coordinate range covered by the image.  The Java class must
be included in the Java classpath and must contain the following methods:
\begin{itemize}
\item
\texttt{constructor(String filename, String extras)}
\item
\texttt{java.awt.image.BufferedImage read()}
\item
\texttt{java.awt.geom.Rectangle2D getBounds()}
\end{itemize}

The methods may throw any type of Java exception on error.
This option enables Mapyrus to
be extended to read additional image formats. \\

\subsubsection{gradientfill}

\begin{alltt}
gradientfill \textit{color1}, \textit{color2}, \textit{color3}, \textit{color4} [, \textit{color5} \ldots]
\end{alltt}

Fills the current path with a gradient fill pattern.
Color names \textit{color1}, \textit{color2}, \textit{color3} and
\textit{color4} define the color for the lower-left corner,
lower-right corner, upper-left corner and upper-right corner of
the polygon.

If \textit{color5} is given then it defines an additional color at the
the center of the polygon.

Colors in the interior of the polygon fade from the color defined
in each corner to the colors in the other corners.

The winding rule is used for determining the inside and outside
regions of polygons containing islands.
The current path and current color are not modified by this command.

For SVG output only gradient fill patterns that fade in one dimension
(vertically or horizontally) are possible.  This is a limitation
of the SVG format.

\subsubsection{guillotine}

\begin{alltt}
guillotine \textit{x1}, \textit{y1}, \textit{x2}, \textit{y2}
\end{alltt}

Cuts path against a rectangle.
Any part of the path inside or
on the boundary of the rectangle remains.
Any part of the path outside the rectangle is removed.
The points
(\textit{x1}, \textit{y1}) and (\textit{x2}, \textit{y2}) define
any two opposite corners of the rectangle to cut against.

The four corner points of the rectangle
are first transformed through any world coordinate
transformation set with a \texttt{worlds} command,
then scaled and rotated by \texttt{scale}
and \texttt{rotate} values.

The path is always cut against a rectangle
aligned with the X and Y axes of the page, regardless of any rotation angle.

\subsubsection{hexagon}

\begin{alltt}
hexagon \textit{xCenter}, \textit{yCenter}, \textit{radius}
\end{alltt}

Adds a hexagon shape to the current path, with center
point (\textit{xCenter}, \textit{yCenter}) and distance
\textit{radius}
from the center point to each vertex.

The center point and radius are transformed through any
transformation set with a \textit{worlds} command,
then scaled and rotated by \textit{scale}
and \textit{rotate} values.

\subsubsection{httpresponse}

\begin{alltt}
httpresponse \textit{header}
\end{alltt}

Sets the complete header to return from an HTTP request
when Mapyrus is running as an HTTP server.  The header
must include at least two lines containing an HTTP server
response code and a MIME content type.  See section \ref{cookies}
for example HTTP headers.

\subsubsection{icon}

\begin{alltt}
icon \textit{filename}, [, \textit{size}]
icon "\textit{binarydigits}" [, \textit{size}]
icon "0x\textit{hexdigits}" [, \textit{size}]
icon "resource:\textit{resourcename}" [, \textit{size}]
\end{alltt}

Displays an image icon at each \texttt{move} point in
the current path.  The icon is centered at each point.

\textit{filename} is a the name of a file, URL or Java resource
containing the icon.
The icon must be either \texttt{BMP}, \texttt{GIF}, \texttt{JPEG},
\texttt{PAT}\footnote{The Gimp pattern file format},
\texttt{PNG},
\texttt{PPM} or
\texttt{XBM} image format.

\textit{binarydigits} are 16, 64 or 256 binary digits (all 0's and 1's)
defining a square single color bitmap of size 4x4, 8x8 or 16x16 pixels.
Any other characters in the string are ignored.

\textit{hexdigits} are 4, 16 or 64 hexadecimal digits defining
a square single color bitmap image of size 4x4, 8x8 or 16x16 pixels.
Any non-hexadecimal characters in the string are ignored.

\textit{resourcename} is the name of the Java resource containing the
image, in the form \texttt{au/com/company/filename.png}.
This option enables images from a Java JAR file included in the 
in the \texttt{-classpath} startup option to be displayed.

\textit{size} is the optional size for the icon in millimeters.  If no size
is given or size is zero then the icon is displayed at its natural size,
as it would appear in an image viewer with one image pixel per display
pixel.
The image is scaled and rotated according to the current \texttt{scale}
and \texttt{rotate} settings.

In PostScript and PDF files, icons with more than one color
are displayed with an opaque white background.  This is a limitation
of PostScript and PDF output.

Icon images are loaded into memory.
Loading very large images will use a large amount of memory.
Page \pageref{morememory} describes how to make more memory available
for Mapyrus.

Icons cannot be displayed when creating SVG format output.

\subsubsection{justify}

\begin{alltt}
justify \textit{justification}
\end{alltt}

Sets justification for labelling with the \texttt{label} command.
\textit{justification} is a string containing either
\texttt{left}, \texttt{right}, \texttt{center} for justifying labels
horizontally and/or
\texttt{top}, \texttt{middle}, \texttt{bottom} for justifying labels
vertically.

\subsubsection{key}

\begin{alltt}
key \textit{type}, \textit{description}, [\textit{arg1}, \textit{arg2} ...]
\end{alltt}

Defines an entry for a legend.  The procedure containing this command will be
called with arguments \textit{arg1}, \textit{arg2} ... to display a sample of
the symbol when a legend is generated with a \texttt{legend} command.  This
command is ignored if used outside of a procedure.

If \textit{description} contains the string \texttt{(\#)} then it will
be replaced in a legend by the number of times that the legend entry
is defined.

\textit{type} is either
\texttt{point} to display the legend entry as a single point,
\texttt{line} to display the legend entry as a horizontal line,
\texttt{zigzag} to display the legend entry as a zig-zag line,
or
\texttt{box} to display the legend as a box.
\textit{description} is the label for the legend entry.

If a procedure displays more than one type of type of symbol depending
on the arguments passed to it then use a separate
\texttt{key} command for each, with different descriptions
and different arguments.

\subsubsection{label}

\begin{alltt}
label \textit{string} [, \textit{string} ...]
\end{alltt}

Draws a label at each point in the path set with the \texttt{move} command,
using the font, justification and rotation set with the \texttt{font},
\texttt{justify} and \texttt{rotate} commands.  \textit{string} values are
separated by spaces.  If \textit{string} contains newline characters
(\texttt{\textbackslash{}n}) then labels are displayed as multiple lines, one
below the other.

\subsubsection{legend}

\begin{alltt}
legend \textit{size}
\end{alltt}

Displays legend entries defined with
\texttt{key} commands at points defined with
\texttt{move} commands.

Each legend entry corresponds to a procedure and a set of arguments.  The first
legend entry is displayed at the first \texttt{move} point by calling the
procedure in which the first legend entry was defined.  Then the second legend
entry is displayed at the second \texttt{move} point.  This continues until
either all legend entries are displayed or all move points are used.

The variable
\texttt{Mapyrus.key.count}
contains the number of legend entries that remain to be displayed.

If there are more legend entries than 
\texttt{move} points then some legend entries
remain undisplayed and will be displayed in the next legend.

Legend entries are displayed in the order in which they
are encountered in called procedures.

Legend entries in procedures that were never called are
not included in the legend.  Therefore, the legend only shows
entries that were actually displayed.

\textit{size} defines the size of each legend entry, in millimeters.

The description label is displayed to the right of each legend entry, using the
current \texttt{color}, \texttt{font} and \texttt{justify} settings.

\subsubsection{let}

\begin{alltt}
let \textit{var} = \textit{expression}, \dots
\end{alltt}

Assigns result of evaluating \textit{expression} to a variable with name
\textit{var}.  The variable is globally accessible unless defined as local to
the current procedure with a \texttt{local} command.

Variable \textit{var} is either a simple variable name, an array, or an array
element of the form \textit{var}[\textit{index}].

Several variables are assigned by separating each 
\textit{var} and \textit{expression} pair by a comma.

\subsubsection{linestyle}

\begin{alltt}
linestyle \textit{width}
linestyle \textit{width}, \textit{cap}, \textit{join}

\end{alltt}

Sets style line drawing by the \texttt{stroke}
command.
Line \textit{width} given in millimeters.
\textit{cap} is the style to use at the ends of lines, either
\texttt{butt}, \texttt{round} or \texttt{square}.
\textit{join} is the style to use where lines join, either
\texttt{bevel}, \texttt{miter} or \texttt{round}.
One or more \textit{dash length} values are given, alternating
between the length of one dash and the length of space between
dashes in a dash pattern.  Each \textit{dash length} is given in millimeters.
\textit{phase} is the offset in millimeters into the dash pattern 
at which to begin.

\subsubsection{local}

\begin{alltt}
local \textit{name}, [\textit{name} ...]
\end{alltt}

Declares the listed variable names as local to a procedure.
The variables are not visible outside the enclosing procedure
and their values are lost when the procedure ends.

\subsubsection{logspiral}

\begin{alltt}
logspiral \textit{xCenter}, \textit{yCenter}, \textit{a}, \textit{b}, \textit{revolutions}, \textit{startAngle}
\end{alltt}

Adds a logarithmic spiral to the current path, with center
point (\textit{xCenter}, \textit{yCenter}).  The values \textit{a}
and \textit{b} are used in the polar coordinates formula
\begin{math}r = ae^{b\theta}\end{math}
to generate the spiral points.

\textit{revolutions} defines the number of loops of the spiral.
If \textit{revolutions}
is a positive number then the spiral is drawn in a anti-clockwise direction.
If \textit{revolutions} is a negative number then the spiral
is drawn in an clockwise direction.

\textit{startAngle} defines the
angle at which the inner revolution of the spiral starts.

The center point and start angle are transformed through any
transformation set with a \textit{worlds} command,
then scaled and rotated by \textit{scale}
and \textit{rotate} values.

\subsubsection{mimetype}

\begin{alltt}
mimetype \textit{type}
\end{alltt}

Sets MIME type for content being returned from HTTP request
when Mapyrus is running as an HTTP server.  A more general
solution is to use the \texttt{httpresponse} command to set
the complete header returned from the HTTP request.

\subsubsection{move}

\begin{alltt}
move \textit{x}, \textit{y}
\end{alltt}

Adds the point (\textit{x}, \textit{y}) to the current path.  The
point is first transformed through any world coordinate
transformation set with a \texttt{worlds} command,
then scaled and rotated by \texttt{scale}
and \texttt{rotate} values.

\subsubsection{newpage}

\begin{alltt}
newpage \textit{format}, \textit{filename}, \textit{width}, \textit{height}, \textit{extras}
newpage \textit{format}, \textit{filename}, \textit{paper}, \textit{extras}
\end{alltt}

Begins output of a new page to a file.  Any previous output is closed.  The
path, clipping path and world coordinates are cleared.  The origin of
the new page is in the lower-left corner.  \textit{format} is the
file format to use for output, one of:

\begin{itemize}
\item
\texttt{eps} for Encapsulated PostScript output,
with shapes and labels defined geometrically.
\item
\texttt{ps}, \texttt{postscript} or \texttt{application/postscript}
for PostScript output,
with shapes and labels defined geometrically.
\item
\texttt{pdf} or \texttt{application/pdf} for Portable Document
Format output.
\item
\texttt{screen} to display output in a window on the screen.
\item
\texttt{bmp} or \texttt{image/bmp} for BMP image output.
\item
\texttt{jpeg} or \texttt{image/jpeg} for JPEG image output.
\item
\texttt{png} or \texttt{image/png} for PNG image output.
\item
\texttt{ppm} or \texttt{image/x-portable-pixmap} for Netpbm PPM image output.
\item
\texttt{epsimage} for Encapsulated PostScript image output.
Output contains
a single image in which all shapes and labels have been drawn.
\item
\texttt{svg} or \texttt{image/svg+xml} for Scalable Vector Graphics
(SVG) output.
\end{itemize}

\textit{paper} is a paper size name for the page.
Alternatively, \textit{width} and \textit{height} are the dimensions of the page
in millimeters, or as values such as \texttt{256px} or \texttt{11in}
including the units.

\textit{filename} is the name of the file to write the page to.
If \textit{filename} is a dash (\texttt{-})
then the page is written to standard output.
If \textit{filename} begins with a pipe (\texttt{|}) then the rest
of \textit{filename} is interpreted as an operating system
command.  The operating system command is executed and Mapyrus
writes the page to the standard input of the executing
operating system command.

\textit{extras} defines further options for the new page, given as
\textit{variable=value} values, separated by whitespace.
See Table \ref{outputformats}
for options available for each type of output.

Replaces current path with new paths parallel to current path.
For each given distance, a new path is created at \textit{distance}
millimeters to the right of current path.  If a \textit{distance} is
negative then path is created to the left of the current path.

When used on complex paths with sharp angles, this command creates
paths that self-intersect.

in millimeters.  If no size
is given or size is zero then the file is displayed at its natural size,
as defined in the PDF file.
The file is scaled and rotated according to the current \texttt{scale}
and \texttt{rotate} settings.

PDF files can only be displayed when creating
PDF output.  For other formats,
a grey box is drawn showing where the PDF file
would be drawn.

\subsubsection{pdfgroup}

\begin{alltt}
pdfgroup \textit{action} [, \textit{groupName}]
\end{alltt}

Controls creation of groups in PDF output files (known as
\textit{Optional Content Groups} in PDF terminology).

be turned on and off independently of other groups.

The \textit{action} \texttt{begin} and a group name begins a group.
All following output until the matching \texttt{end} action is
included in the group.

The \textit{action} \texttt{end} completes a group.  Any open groups are
automatically ended when a PDF output file is finished.

Nesting of groups is permitted.

For formats other than PDF, this command has no effect.

The function \texttt{protected} will then return 1 for any
point in this region.

The points
(\textit{x1}, \textit{y1}) and (\textit{x2}, \textit{y2}) define
any two opposite corners of the rectangle to mark as protected.

If \textit{geometry} containing a polygon is given, then the region
covered by that polygon is protected.

If no arguments are given then the region inside the current path is
protected.

The rectangle or geometry
is first transformed through any world coordinate
transformation set with a \texttt{worlds} command,
then scaled and rotated by \texttt{scale}
and \texttt{rotate} values.

\subsubsection{raindrop}

\textit{offset} is the distance along the path at which to place first point,
given in millimeters.  \textit{spacing} is the distance between points, given
in millimeters.  The sign of \textit{spacing} controls the direction in which
the path is travelled.  If \textit{spacing} is a positive value, the path is
travelled from the beginning towards the end.  If \textit{spacing} is a
negative value, then the absolute value of \textit{spacing} is used and the
path is travelled from the end towards the beginning.  Using a very large
positive or negative value for \textit{spacing} results in current path being
replaced by a single point at the beginning or end of the path.

\subsubsection{scale}

\begin{alltt}
scale \textit{factor}
\end{alltt}

Scales the coordinate system, adding to any existing scaling.  \textit{factor}

\end{longtable}

\subsection{Error Handling}

If Mapyrus encounters an error when interpreting commands,
an error message is printed including the filename and line number
at which the error occurred and Mapyrus exits immediately.
The Java interpreter exits with a non-zero status.

If an error occurs when using the HTTP Server
option, an HTTP failure status and the error message
are returned to the HTTP client.  The HTTP server continues,
handling the next request.

\subsection{Mapyrus HTTP Server}

Mapyrus runs as an HTTP server when started with the \texttt{-s} command line
option.

The HTTP server accepts and replies to requests from HTTP clients on the given
port number.  If port number is 0 then any free port number is used.  The port
number used is written to the log file or to standard output.

The HTTP server is multi-threaded to enable several requests to be handled
simultaneously.  If the HTTP server receives an HTTP request for a file with a
suffix matching a well-known MIME type (such as \texttt{html}, \texttt{txt},
\texttt{ps}, \texttt{pdf}, \texttt{svg}, \texttt{zip}
or a web image format), then the
contents of that file are returned by the HTTP server to the HTTP client.
Requests for files with no suffix, or with unknown file suffix
such as \texttt{.mapyrus} are interpreted
by Mapyrus using the following steps.

\begin{enumerate}
\item
Set any parameters passed in the URL (following the \texttt{?} character in
the URL or passed in an HTML form) as variables in Mapyrus.
Variable names are converted to uppercase.
\item
Read and execute the commands from the filename given in the URL.
\item
Capture the standard output of these commands and return it to the
HTTP client.
An image file is returned if the
\texttt{newpage} command is used with output file set
to standard output.
Otherwise the output of any \texttt{print} commands is returned.
The HTTP header information set in a
\texttt{mimetype}
or
\texttt{httpresponse}
command is returned to the HTTP client.

An HTTP error state is returned if the request fails.
\end{enumerate}

Requests using either GET or POST methods are accepted by Mapyrus.

The HTTP server runs forever and
is stateless.  Each HTTP request is independent and
variables, graphics state and legend entries are not shared between
requests.
Any files or URLs given on the command line when Mapyrus is started
are interpreted before accepting HTTP requests.
Procedures defined in these files
are available when interpreting HTTP requests.  This enables
common procedures to be loaded only once at startup and not with every
HTTP request.

Files are not cached and are read for each HTTP request.

For security, the HTTP server only replies to requests
from the directory in which Mapyrus was started and its subdirectories.
Requests for files from other directories return an error to the HTTP client.
If communication between HTTP client and Mapyrus is blocked for longer than
5 minutes then the HTTP request is cancelled.
When all threads in the HTTP server are busy handling requests,
further requests are queued.

Logging of HTTP requests is controlled by the \texttt{-l} command line option.

\subsection{Mapyrus Servlet}

The file \texttt{mapyrus.war} provided with Mapyrus
is a web application archive.

After being deployed in a web server, the Mapyrus servlet handles HTTP
requests to the following URL.

\begin{verbatim}
http://localhost:8080/mapyrus/servlet
\end{verbatim}

An example web page with an HTML form for the user
to enter Mapyrus commands, submit them to the Mapyrus servlet
and obtain the output is provided at the following URL.

\begin{verbatim}
http://localhost:8080/mapyrus
\end{verbatim}

The commands to be run by Mapyrus servlet are passed in
the URL parameter \texttt{commands} in the HTTP request.

Any other parameters passed in the URL (following the \texttt{?} character
in the URL or passed in an HTML form) are set as variables in Mapyrus.
Variable names are converted to uppercase.

Normally, the Mapyrus commands in the HTTP request will be generated
programmatically or entered in an HTML form.  Mapyrus commands
passed programmatically must be converted to a form suitable for
a URL.  In Java, this is done using methods from
the Java class \texttt{java.net.URLEncoder}.

By default, Mapyrus servlet blocks access to files and URLs.
To enable access, set the servlet initialisation
parameter \texttt{io} to \texttt{true} in
the servlet configuration file \texttt{WEB-INF/web.xml}
contained in the web application file \texttt{mapyrus.war}.

The standard output of the Mapyrus commands is returned from
the HTTP request.  A
\texttt{mimetype}
or
\texttt{httpresponse}
command must be used to define the type of output being returned.

If a JNDI DataSource is setup in the web server to provide 
database connection pooling then database connections from the
pool are available using the \texttt{jndiname} option in
the \texttt{dataset} command.

If JTS Topology Suite functions or a JDBC driver are used then the
\textit{JTS Topology Suite} or JDBC JAR file must be made available
to the web server by copying it into a directory that the web server
includes in the Java classpath.

The Mapyrus servlet throws a Java ServletException if there is an error
in the Mapyrus commands, or an error running the Mapyrus commands.

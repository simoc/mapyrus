<p>
The Mapyrus GUI provides a single application for entering and
editing Mapyrus commands, running these commands, and viewing the output.
</p>

<p>
The Mapyrus GUI is divided into five regions:
<ol>

<li>
The <b>menu bar</b> containing menu options for loading, saving
and exporting.
</li>

<li>
The <b>display area</b> containing the graphical output of Mapyrus commands.
A crosshair cursor with the world coordinates of the current mouse
position is displayed as the mouse is moved around the display area.
</li>

<li>
The <b>tool bar</b> containing buttons to start and stop the
running of Mapyrus commands.
</li>

<li>
The <b>command editor</b>, a text editor for Mapyrus commands.
</li>

<li>
The <b>command output area</b> showing messages printed by Mapyrus commands.
</li>

</ol>
</p>

<p>
At startup, the <b>command editor</b> contains sample commands.
Clicking the green arrow button in the <b>tool bar</b> runs these commands
and displays the output in the <b>display area</b>.
</p>

<p>
Edit these commands, or load other commands from a file
using the <b>menu bar</b> File-&gt;Open File option.
Then click the green arrow button again to see the output of the
new commands.
The output of any Mapyrus <code>PRINT</code> commands is
shown in the <b>command output area</b>.
Any error message from Mapyrus is displayed in an error message dialog box.
</p>

<p>
The <b>menu bar</b> option File-&gt;New Tab creates a new tab in
the <b>command editor</b> enabling multiple sets of commands to
be worked on simultaneously.
</p>

<p>
Display output is automatically set to the <b>display area</b> before
running Mapyrus commands so no Mapyrus <code>NEWPAGE</code> command
is required.
</p>

<p>
The <b>menu bar</b> menu options Edit-&gt;Export and Edit-&gt;Copy
enable the <b>display area</b> output to be captured.
